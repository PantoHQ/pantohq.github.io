Hitchen's, again, introduced me to the word *evince* in [this video][vid] discussing the Obama/McCain campaigns in 2008.

You will not have failed to recognise the similarity to *convince* and the etymology confirms their relationship. In Latin there was both *evincere* and *convincere*.

Convince seems to grow out of the latin prefix *com* or *cum* meaning "together", whereas the latin derived prefix *ex*, shortened in evince, means "from within". Both improve *vince*, which seems to mean "conquer".

Both words, then, have to do with annexing conceptual positions, and might evince mean to discover a position revealed from within something opaque or: in other words to "reveal the presence of".
