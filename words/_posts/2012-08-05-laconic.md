If you, like me, are interested in words, and embrace not knowing them, you should listen to Christopher Hitchens, and have Google and the wonderful [Online Etymology Dictionary](http://etymonline.com) a tab away.

"BoredGreg asks in a rather laconic way" Hitch observed in [a video][vid] I was watching. The word is similar to *terse* **meaning concise or abrupt**. Deriving from the Greek *Lakonikos* meaning a person from Lakonia, the district around Sparta whose inhabitants strove for briefness in conversation.

From [etymonline.com](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=laconic&allowed_in_frame=0):

> When Philip of Macedon threatened them with, "If I enter Laconia, I will raze Sparta to the ground," the Spartans' reply was, "If."
