> It is absurd to enter into a long recapitulation of arguments sufficiently familiar to those inquiring minds, whom alone a writer on **abstruse** subjects can be conceived to address.

Percy Shelly, The Necessity of Atheism (1813)

*"Ab"* meaning away, *"trudere"* meaning to thrust. *Abstruse*: difficult to understand.
