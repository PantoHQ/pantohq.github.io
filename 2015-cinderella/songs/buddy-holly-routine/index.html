                    <p>Hyacinth and Lowercinth are at the ball! They woo Charming, who's trying to get away, by singing "All of my love, all of my kissing, you don't know what you've been missing." Things start getting heated and Charming interrupts: he has to go. "That'll be the day..." they sing on trying to convince him to stay. When Charming threatens to have them executed the sisters respond: "wai...wait...whh.. the little things you say and do, make me want to be with you" but this final song is too late as Charming has already escaped.</p>
                    <p style="font-size:12px">Songs include: "Oh Boy", "That'll Be The Day" and "Rave On"</p>
