Hi everyone. Great job on Sunday overviewing those 7 songs, I was super impressed by how good [Buddy Holly Routine](songs/buddy-holly-routine/) sounded and just in general we've really started with some momentum!

Since we have an absolute max of 7 more rehearsals together **we need to each come prepared for our parts**. Each meetup I'll choose 3 songs to get as perfect as possible for the following rehearsal. So:

### Learn For Next Rehearsal

* [Madness](songs/madness): Fully (top priority)
* [Buddy Holly Routune](songs/buddy-holly-routine): Fully (leeway for our own style here)
* [Burning Love](songs/burning-love): Just get aquainted with it's rhythms (specifically verse 2)

See you next time,  
Marcus
