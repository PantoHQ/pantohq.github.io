		<h2>Multi Colour Complexity?</h2>
		<p>I'm very interested in telling the story with interesting colour combinations. This lighting setup looks very complex, but could curtain/backdrop lighting be different to stage/stoplight stuff? </p>

		<h2>Depth of Field with Colour</h2>
		<p>In particular I'd like to anchor colours to scene locations whilst not overwhelming the cast. We could do this by applying that colour to the background and lighting front of stage with white light creating a depth to the scene.</p>
		<p>Notice below that Cinderella (back left) appears more red, and therefor part of the background, whilst the eye focuses on the three center stage characters who are bathed in white light.</p>

		<h2>Ethereal Sparklyness</h2>
		<p>Two scenes require this magical sparkly lighting, including the carriage reveal. In this reference image there's blue fill lights (from the roof) with white spotlights on the carraige. The sparkly backdrop and smoke really sells the magic though!</p>

		<h2>Sparkly Backdrop</h2>
		<p>I think we can make use of the sparkly backdrop in the last scene of Act I and all the ballroom scenes in Act II. We could attach it to backboard anytime after the first scene (during a scene/song in front of curtains) or during the intermission.</p>

		<h2>Song Momentum</h2>
		<p>Obviously moving lights would be awesome (and probably expensive and hard to operate?) but having lights move all over the place seems to be the difference between awkward dancing and selling the emotion of the scene.</p>
		<p>The white spot roof lights in the image below are moving out into the audience as the cast raise their hands at the end of the song.</p>
		<p>In general it's the principle of lighting momentum matching the song that matters to me. So we could achieve the same effect with a disco ball and a torch.</p>

		<h2>Moving Lights</h2>
		<p>Here's a more simple/subtle example of lighting momentum, with three pink spots moving randomly around the stage during an upbeat song. Maybe we could recreate this with spotlights if we had more than one.</p>
