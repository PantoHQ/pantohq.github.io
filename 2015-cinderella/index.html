                <p>
                    Once there was a time like no other time before, <br>
                    Hope was still and open door, once upon a dream.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And I was unafraid, the dream was so exciting! <br>
                    But now I see it fade, and I am here alone!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once upon a dream, you were heaven-sent to me, <br>
                    Was it never meant to be? Was it just a dream?
                <p>
                <p>
                    Could we being again? Once upon a dream.

                    And now I need to know is this real love, <br>
                    Or is it just madness keeping us afloat?
                </p>
                <p>
                    But I have finally seen the light, <br>
                    And I have finally realised...
                </p>
                <p>
                    I need to love, <br>
                    I need to love
                <p>
                <p>
                    Come to me, just in a dream, come on and rescue me. <br>
                    Yes I know, I can be wrong, maybe I'm to headstrong.

                <p>
                    There's a light, a certain kind of light, that never shone on me. <br>
                    And I'd like my life to be, lived with her, lived with her.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There's a way, everybody say, to do each and every little thing. <br>
                    But what does it bring, if I ain't got her, if I ain't got her?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ohhoh you don't know what it's like, ohhoh you don't know what it's like <br>
                    To love somebody, to love somebody, the way I love... her.

                <p>
                    Many nights you've prayed, with no proof anyone could hear, <br>
                    In your heart a hopeful song you bearely understood. <br>
                    But now you're not afraid, although you know there's much to fear, <br>
                    You were moving mountains long before you knew you could.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There can be miracles, when you believe, <br>
                    Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill. <br>
                    Who knows what miracles you can achieve, <br>
                    When you believe somehow you will, you will when you believe.

                    But you weren't honest, now get in the cellar!
                </p>
                <p>
                    You choked off the surest of favors, <br>
                    But if you really loved me, you would've endured my world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hang on to the glory at my right hand, <br>
                    Here laid to rest is our love ever longed, <br>
                    With truth on the shores of compassion. <br>
                    You seem to take premise to all of these...
                </p>
                <p>
                    One last chance for you, one more wish to you, <br>
                    Please make up your mind girl, I'd do anything for you <br>
                    ...last chance for you, one more wish to you, <br>
                    Please make up your mind girl, Before I hope you
